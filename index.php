        something appealingly old-fashioned about a literary success story. This holds especially true for the
        tale of Benedict Wells, the 34-year-old German wunderkind who survived a downright Dickensian childhood 
        before emerging as a cultural sensation in his native country. Wells was only six when illness and 
        financial troubles shattered his household, forcing his parents to send him to state-run Bavarian 
        boarding schools. This early experience informs Wells’s überpersonal fourth novel, The End of Loneliness (Penguin Books),
        an international phenomenon that won the European Union Prize for Literature. The tale centers on 
        the orphaned Jules and his two older siblings, following the trio through a series of events that are 
        unfortunate but also joyful and funny. It is not a perfect novel, but it is a life-affirming work.
        As Jules says near the end, “I’m always surprised by how the light of memory makes particular moments 
        shine brightly.” </h3>";
